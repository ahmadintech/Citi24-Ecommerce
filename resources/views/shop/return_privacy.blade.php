                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Return & Warranty Policy:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">At CITi24, we stand behind the quality of our tech products and offer comprehensive warranty coverage. Our policy is designed to ensure you're completely satisfied with your electronic purchases while maintaining fair conditions for returns and exchanges.</p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Standard Return Policy:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">You may return most new, unopened tech products within 14 days of delivery for a full refund. For opened items, we offer returns within 7 days if the product is defective or doesn't match its description. To initiate a return, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:innovatewithciti@gmail.com">innovatewithciti@gmail.com</a> or call us at +234 901 376 2265.</p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Manufacturer's Warranty:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">All products come with the manufacturer's warranty (typically 1 year unless otherwise specified). CITi24 will facilitate warranty claims during the coverage period. Please retain your original receipt and all packaging materials for warranty service.</p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Extended Warranty Options:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">
                            We offer optional extended warranty plans on select products. These plans provide additional coverage beyond the standard manufacturer's warranty and can be purchased at checkout or within 30 days of your original purchase.
                        </p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">24-Hour Delivery Cancellation:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">Due to our rapid fulfillment process, orders scheduled for same-day delivery cannot be cancelled once processing has begun (typically within 1 hour of order placement). We recommend reviewing your order carefully before finalizing your purchase.</p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Return Shipping:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">For defective products or incorrect shipments, CITi24 will cover return shipping costs. For other returns, customers are responsible for return shipping. All returns must include original packaging, accessories, and documentation.</p>

                        <h1 class="section-header-area">Refund Processing:</h1>
                        <p class="about-us-text">Refunds are processed within 3-5 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item. Your refund will be credited to your original payment method.</p>

                        <p class="about-us-text">Our technical team will evaluate all warranty claims and returns to determine eligibility. Some items may be exempt from returns due to hygiene reasons (earphones, etc.) or software licenses. We're committed to resolving any issues with your tech purchases promptly and fairly.</p>
                        
                        <p class="about-us-text">Thank you for choosing CITi24 for your tech needs. Our 24/7 customer support is always available to assist with any questions about returns, warranties, or your purchases.</p>
